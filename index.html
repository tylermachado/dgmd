	<h2>more final pres</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>the arc: explain inspirations and ideas (from below), and the technical parts because I think in my case that's part of the whole deal</li>
		<li>the visuals: I can show the state of the project, functionally, at many stages of its life. and obviously the final demo.</li>
		<li>what needs to finish: getting it working on a phone. (stretch goal: LED cube)</li>
		<li>deployment: will need to go on Heroku to talk between a phone and a desktop, which I haven't done yet, which I need to figure out</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>21 April 2016</h2>

	<p>what I did: <a href="http://www.tylermachado.com/dgmd/touch/">built a touch thing</a>. it's simple -- the color just changes depending where your finger is in the square. (you have to hit initialize first? and also it only works on a phone)</a></p>

	<p>what I'll do: I want to make it so that moving your finger on this screen doesn't change the view on the phone, but on a second screen somewhere. Maybe even the cube if I get ambitious. But that may not be necessary.</p>

	<p>support I could use: will probably need ongoing help with websockets I suspect</p>

	<h2>final pres brainstorm</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>inspirations: Mark Rothko, Josef Albers, <a href="https://t.d3fc.io/">these baby D3 animations</a>, synth music, the flying butterflies at the Sheraton Toronto</li>
		<li>goals: learn/improve technical skill, think outside literal/professional contexts</li>
		<li>aesthetic: clean, 8 bit, digitally native</li>
		<li>physicality: LED light, interaction across devices</li>
		<li>misc: randomness, simplicity</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>8 April 2016</h2>

	<p>what I did: started implementing a Node/Express server of my own per instrux in today's class</p>

	<p>what I'll do: hook that up to my grid project and figure out what kind of user input should make it change -- currently envisioning a touchpad type thing. And maybe hook *that* up to the LED cube as well?</p>

	<p>support I could use: I think I still need that Johnny-Five/LED cube tutorial thing? Unless I missed an email!</p>

	<h2>31 March 2016</h2>

	<p>what I did: put together L3D cube finally!</p>

	<p>what I'll do: interested in that sort of interface that Alec showed where the background color depends on mouse position -- curious if that's something I could adapt. What if you did that except the screen color was determined by the user's input on a smartphone or other separate device? (Also, maybe web sockets to make this work?)</p>

	<p>support I could use: unclear</p>

	<h2>24 March 2016</h2>

	<p>what I did: tried to find patterns using Javascript math functions</p>

	<p>what I'll do: more of that, also finally put together that LED cube</p>

	<p>support I could use: the "Hello World" tutorial equivalent in the Johnnyfive-and-LED world</p>

	<h2>Week 6</h2>

	<h4><a href="http://www.tylermachado.com/glitchy-gradient-thing/">Early Project Mockup</a></h4>

	<p>ideas for eventual project:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Spectrogram?</li>
		<li>LED 3D Cube?</li>
		<li>different math things?</li>
		<li>time based a la On Kawara?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>next steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>create several versions with different math things</li>
		<li>assemble LED cube</li>
	</ul>




	<h2>Week 5</h2>

	<h4><a href="http://www.tylermachado.com/glitchy-gradient-thing/">Early Project Mockup</a></h4>

	<p>I am doing everything backwards and have come up with form before function. What this demo does is use D3.js to populate a 50x50 square grid. Since it's D3, each of the little squares has one piece of data attached to it (a number from 0-2499). The fill is a random number but within certain bounds relating to that data number, so that I have enough control to preserve the green/blue gradient but enough randomness to create the dynamic moving effect.</p>

	<p>I am happy with the general aesthetic -- it is something I have had vaguely in my head and that's why I jumped right into a code demo instead of sketching. That and I can't draw for shit. However I think the effect of just loading the page and letting random numbers do their thing is kind of unsatisfying. I would like to preserve the grid look and the "living" dynamism of it, but I'd like the visuals to be powered by data, or viewer editable, or something that has a little more meaning.</p>

	<h2>Week 2</h2>

	<p>inspiration: <a href="https://twitter.com/ObliqueBot">@ObliqueBot</a> // bot tweeting "oblique strategies"</p>

	<p>why I like this</p>
	<ul>
		<li>simple design pairing one line of "strategy" text and image</li>
		<li>as a bot, feels serendipitous and mantra-like</li>
	</ul>

	<span>(a thing a developer friend said that got me thinking heavy about the ephemerality of the web)</span>

	<ul>
		<li>another simple explainer of heady concepts</li>
		<li>scroll-powered interactives keep the visuals in sync with text</li>
		<li>animations are super clean and elegant</li>
	</ul>

	<hr/>

	<p>inspiration: <a href="http://ncase.me/polygons/">Parable of the Polygons</a> // explaining bias and diversity</p>

		<li>step-by-step, clear explanations of heady concepts</li>
		<li>demands the viewer stop and engage</li>
		<li>interactivity helps ground the concepts tangibly</li>
		<li>cute animated cartoon characters are relatable</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Week 1</h2>

	<p>Things about Laura:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>all about pink, but not in like a stereotypical way (sketch: <a href="assets/laura1.jpg">on hover, background fades to pink</a>)</li>

		<li>loves food, mostly Indian and Latin (sketch: <a href="assets/laura3.jpg">on hover, background turns into bubbly curry</a>, but this actually sounds disgusting, not gonna do it)</li>
