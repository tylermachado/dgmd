	<h2>Week 6</h2>

	<h4><a href="http://www.tylermachado.com/glitchy-gradient-thing/">Early Project Mockup</a></h4>

	<p>ideas for eventual project:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Spectrogram?</li>
		<li>LED 3D Cube?</li>
		<li>different math things?</li>
		<li>time based a la On Kawara?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>next steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>create several versions with different math things</li>
		<li>assemble LED cube</li>
	</ul>




	<h2>Week 5</h2>

	<h4><a href="http://www.tylermachado.com/glitchy-gradient-thing/">Early Project Mockup</a></h4>

	<p>I am doing everything backwards and have come up with form before function. What this demo does is use D3.js to populate a 50x50 square grid. Since it's D3, each of the little squares has one piece of data attached to it (a number from 0-2499). The fill is a random number but within certain bounds relating to that data number, so that I have enough control to preserve the green/blue gradient but enough randomness to create the dynamic moving effect.</p>

	<p>I am happy with the general aesthetic -- it is something I have had vaguely in my head and that's why I jumped right into a code demo instead of sketching. That and I can't draw for shit. However I think the effect of just loading the page and letting random numbers do their thing is kind of unsatisfying. I would like to preserve the grid look and the "living" dynamism of it, but I'd like the visuals to be powered by data, or viewer editable, or something that has a little more meaning.</p>

	<h2>Week 3</h2>

	<p>why I like this</p>
	<ul>
		<li>dynamic motion</li>
		<li>moves data viz into physical world</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Week 2</h2>

	<p>inspiration: <a href="https://twitter.com/ObliqueBot">@ObliqueBot</a> // bot tweeting "oblique strategies"</p>

	<p>why I like this</p>
	<ul>
		<li>simple design pairing one line of "strategy" text and image</li>
		<li>as a bot, feels serendipitous and mantra-like</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote>i think the non archivability of interactive sites is just a necessary tradeoff for creating something that is interactive and accessible to literally everyone on Earth instantaneously, atop an advanced software stack, at the time of its launch.</blockquote>
	<span>(a thing a developer friend said that got me thinking heavy about the ephemerality of the web)</span>

	<p>inspiration: <a href="http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/">Visual Intro to Machine Learning</a> // exactly what the title says</p>

	<p>why I like this</p>
	<ul>
		<li>another simple explainer of heady concepts</li>
		<li>scroll-powered interactives keep the visuals in sync with text</li>
		<li>animations are super clean and elegant</li>
	</ul>

	<hr/>

	<p>inspiration: <a href="http://ncase.me/polygons/">Parable of the Polygons</a> // explaining bias and diversity</p>

	<p>why I like this</p>
	<ul>
		<li>step-by-step, clear explanations of heady concepts</li>
		<li>demands the viewer stop and engage</li>
		<li>interactivity helps ground the concepts tangibly</li>
		<li>cute animated cartoon characters are relatable</li>
	</ul>

	<hr/>

	<p>inspiration: <a href="https://t.d3fc.io/">t.d3fc.io</a> // tweet-sized D3 animations</p>
	<p>why I like this</p>
	<ul>
		<li>very minimal, simple things</li>
		<li>some are interactive</li>
		<li>art created in pure code -- not even images or anything</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Week 1</h2>

	<p>Things about Laura:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>all about pink, but not in like a stereotypical way (sketch: <a href="assets/laura1.jpg">on hover, background fades to pink</a>)</li>

		<li>loves food, mostly Indian and Latin (sketch: <a href="assets/laura3.jpg">on hover, background turns into bubbly curry</a>, but this actually sounds disgusting, not gonna do it)</li>
	</ul>
